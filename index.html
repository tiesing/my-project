    <h1>TIESING FAM'S F1 WEB</h1>
    <p>My name is <strong>TIESING FAM</strong> ,I am 24 years old from a family of four kids. My home town is Kisumu.I did my primary levels at<strong> M.A junior school and my Highschool level in Usenge boys Highschool</strong>, Afterwhich i learned Deejaying
        and also took German classes</p>
    <p> I have worked as a dj for four years under the name <strong>"MNTRX"</strong> with different entertainment spots in both Kisumu and Nairobi. I have also worked with a company called SupaMall for a period of 6 months as a sales and marketing representative.</p>
    <p> I decided to take programming classes because ive always been intrigued with how programming works and id love to learn how to code, since id wish to some day be able to work with major software and web companies.</p>
    <p>I am a creative person and my hobbies and skills lie within things like creative arts,music and DIY's, I also love cooking,swimming and watching during my free time.</p>
